        <p>Haikel was born on a Friday.</p>
        <p>He is nothing but a curious monkey that wants to tinker around, learn, craft and be the best at what piques his interest. Boredom (and raisins!) is his enemy, and it doesn’t help when his attention span withers into goldfish territory. He would like to be exposed to new situations and challenges and never be allowed to stagnate.</p>
        <p>Before joining the world of the design and , he sailed on a chemical tanker when he was 18,
        became a cook when he was 21, served the Army for two years, graduated from Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts after his military service, and then found himself working in the digital world. All that is true.</p>
